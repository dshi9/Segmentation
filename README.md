## Setup
### Create Virtual Environment
I used python 3.7 but I believe other version of python3 should work too.
It's not required, but I would suggest you to use virtual environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
To Deactivate:
```bash
deactivate
```
### Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
